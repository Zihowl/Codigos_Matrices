# Matrices Rust Project

This project implements basic matrix operations in Rust, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It is designed to be beginner-friendly and demonstrates object-oriented programming principles using Rust's struct and method features.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **Cargo.toml**: Configuration file for the Rust project, specifying package name, version, dependencies, and other metadata.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project, explaining how to use the matrix operations and providing examples.
- **src/main.rs**: Entry point of the application. Initializes the program, creates instances of matrices, and handles user input for performing matrix operations.
- **src/matrix.rs**: Defines the `Matrix` struct, encapsulating properties and methods for matrix operations, including creation, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and display.
- **src/input.rs**: Contains utility functions for handling user input, including reading integers from the console and validating the input.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to build and execute the project:

   ```
   cargo run
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to create matrices and perform operations.

## Examples

- To create two matrices, you will be prompted to enter the number of rows and columns, followed by the elements of each matrix.
- After creating the matrices, you can choose to add, subtract, or multiply them based on their dimensions.
